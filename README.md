# Covid19TestLab
The aim of this repository is to act as a central location for aset of guidelines, SoPs, methodologies, software etc. for turning a research lab with PCR and RNA expertise into an industrial scale  covid-19 testing facility.

Any lab working on doing this is welcome and encouraged to join in here so we can 'open source' how to do this. If we can all learn from each other we will be able to improve the way we do things and act as a source of information to all.
